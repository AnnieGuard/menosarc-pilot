# MenoSarc™ — Reducing Late-Stage Sarcoma Burden in Post-Menopausal Women Across the NHS

A free, 6-month manual pilot for NHS cancer alliances, integrated care boards (ICBs), and specialist sarcoma centres.  
No integration. No contract. Just measurable impact.

---

## The Opportunity

Late-stage sarcoma care places significant strain on NHS budgets and capacity due to:
- Complex surgery often requiring reconstruction
- Radiotherapy and multi-line systemic therapy
- Higher recurrence and readmission rates
- Increased use of high-dependency beds and specialist services

By identifying biologically aggressive post-menopausal sarcomas earlier, MenoSarc enables:
- Timelier treatment planning and specialist referral
- Reduced demand on surgical and oncology resources
- Improved patient outcomes in a rare, high-cost cancer category

Estimated savings: £65K–£90K per late-stage case avoided  
(based on NHS oncology treatment cost benchmarks and GIRFT surgical cost data)

## The Challenge

Post-menopausal women with sarcoma often present late, even when the disease is biologically aggressive.  
Conventional staging pathways miss early biological changes, delaying curative interventions.

---

## Our Evidence Base

From 5,187 patient records across multi-institutional U.S. cohorts (with UK validation planned), our research shows:
- Menopause acts as a biological switch in sarcoma — changing tumour subtype, mutation load, and treatment eligibility.
- 65.6% of extremity sarcomas in post-menopausal women are diagnosed late-stage.
- Significant rise in genomic instability (FGA) post-menopause.
- 72% of leiomyosarcoma cases occur post-menopause.
- High TMB and low tumour purity are strongly linked to aggressive progression.

## How the Pilot Works

Day 1 – Securely share deidentified case data (age, sex, diagnosis, basic pathology, optional tumour features)  
Day 3 – Receive your MenoSarc Risk Report: risk score, key findings, clinical recommendations  

48-hour turnaround for all cases.

## NHS Workflow & Patient Pathway Stage

Trigger Point:  
A multi-disciplinary team (MDT) coordinator, specialist nurse, or cancer pathway manager identifies a suspected or confirmed sarcoma case in a post-menopausal woman.  
This typically occurs at pathology confirmation or referral to an NHS sarcoma specialist centre.

Action:  
- Extract the available clinical and pathology fields from NHS EPR systems, Somerset Cancer Register, or MDT proformas (see "Data We Need" below)  
- Send deidentified case data to AnnieGuard via secure NHSmail or encrypted upload  
- Receive a MenoSarc Risk Report within 48 hours, including:  
  - Risk stratification  
  - Key biological drivers  
  - Potential cost avoidance estimate  

Use:  
- Share results at the next MDT meeting  
- Adjust treatment planning and referral urgency  
- Track cost avoidance and stage migration over the pilot period to support commissioning decisions
