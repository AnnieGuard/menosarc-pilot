## Background
The **MenoSarc‚Ñ¢ Early Detection Pilot** aims to transform sarcoma detection by closing a critical blind spot in oncology: the **peri-menopause window (ages 45‚Äì51)**.  

From analysis of **5,000+ sarcoma cases**, AnnieGuard discovered that tumors classified as ‚Äúlow-risk‚Äù Stage I in women 45‚Äì51 are biologically Stage III**. These hidden late-biology cases progress silently and drive **$300K‚Äì$400K per patient in catastrophic costs** when missed.  

By embedding **AnnieGuard‚Äôs MenoSarc‚Ñ¢** into existing EHR and payer workflows, the pilot delivers **biological risk visibility months to years earlier**, creating a new standard for **precision oncology and value-based rare-disease care**.

## Information for Pilot Participants
Organizations selected for the MenoSarc‚Ñ¢ Pilot will:  
- **Contribute retrospective de-identified EHR datasets** (100‚Äì300 peri-menopausal women with soft tissue sarcoma).  
- Receive a **population-level report within 7 days**, including:  
  - Patient-level sarcoma risk scores  
  - Identification of **hidden Stage III/IV cases** within early-stage diagnoses  
  - Modeled **cost-avoidance estimates** ($200K‚Äì$300K avoided per patient ‚Üí ~$2M+ per 100 cases)  
  - Alignment with **CMS quality metrics** (STAR, HEDIS, MIPS, ACO shared savings)  
- **Validate real-world ROI** through retrospective analysis.  
- **Prepare for automation**: the pilot is delivered manual-first to build trust, then scales seamlessly to full EHR-native deployment.  

Participation is **voluntary** and available to **ACOs, Medicare Advantage Organizations (MAOs), Medicaid Agencies (MAs), and commercial payers** interested in advancing rare cancer detection, cost savings, and equity outcomes.

## What Patients Receive
Patients whose records are included in the pilot will **not incur any additional costs**. Participating organizations can expect:  
- **Earlier identification of sarcoma risk** at the first sign of unexplained lumps, swelling, or pain.  
- **Personalized risk stratification** that incorporates molecular (VEGF, CDK4/6, PRAME, FBP2) and demographic factors (age, sex, menopause status).  
- **Clear, patient-centered care pathways**, aligning diagnosis and treatment with patient preferences.  
- **Equity impact**: proactive detection for women 40+ and underserved populations disproportionately affected by late-stage sarcoma.

## Model Details
**Goals of the MenoSarc‚Ñ¢ Pilot:**  
- Place **early detection and prevention** at the center of rare cancer care.  
- **Integrate novel biology-driven risk model** (MenoSarc‚Ñ¢) into existing clinical workflows.  
- **Reduce catastrophic late-stage sarcoma spend** by enabling intervention in the menopause ‚Äúswitch‚Äù window (45‚Äì51).  
- **Support value-based care** and **protect ACO shared savings pools**.  
- Advance **equity in rare cancers**, particularly for peri- and post-menopausal women.  

**Design Elements:**  
- EHR-integrated retrospective analysis (manual-first).  
- Population-level risk reports with financial + quality metrics.  
- Seamless pathway to automation via secure **Azure Container Registry deployment**.  
- Supports **alignment with CMS pilots** such as EOM, ACO REACH, and WISeR.
