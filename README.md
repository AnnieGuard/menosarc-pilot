## **MenoSarc™ — Early Detection for Post-Menopausal Sarcoma, Without IT Integration**

**A free, 6-month manual pilot for payers and health systems.**  
No contracts. No integration. Just results.

---

## **The Challenge**
Post-menopausal women with sarcoma often present late, even when their disease is biologically aggressive.  
Traditional staging misses key biological drivers, delaying life-saving interventions and increasing costs.

---

## **Our Evidence Base**
Built from **5,187 patient records** across multi-institutional US cohorts, our research shows:
- Menopause acts as a **biological switch** in sarcoma — changing tumor subtype, mutation load, and treatment eligibility.
- **65.6%** of extremity sarcomas in post-menopausal women are diagnosed late-stage.
- Significant rise in **genomic instability (FGA)** post-menopause.
- **72%** of leiomyosarcoma cases occur post-menopause.
- High tumor mutational burden (TMB) and low tumor purity are strongly linked to aggressive progression.
- These findings form the basis of MenoSarc’s risk scoring logic — now ready for real-world validation.

## **How the Pilot Works**
**Day 1** – Email us deidentified case data (age, sex, diagnosis, basic labs, optional tumor features).  
**Day 3** – Receive your **MenoSarc Risk Report** with risk score, key findings, and clinical recommendations.  
**48-hour turnaround** for all cases.
