# MenoSarc™ — Cut Late-Stage Sarcoma Costs by 30% in Post-Menopausal Women

A free, 6-month manual pilot for payers and health systems.  
No contracts. No integration. Just measurable ROI.

---

## The Financial Opportunity

Late-stage sarcoma care can cost 3–5× more than early-stage intervention due to:
- Complex surgery with reconstruction
- Radiation and multi-line systemic therapy
- Increased recurrence and readmission rates

By detecting aggressive post-menopausal sarcomas before they present clinically, MenoSarc enables:
- Earlier, lower-cost interventions
- Reduced recurrence-related spend
- Improved outcomes for high-cost oncology patients

Estimated savings: $85K–$120K per late-stage case avoided  
(based on US payer oncology cost benchmarks)

---

## The Challenge

Post-menopausal women with sarcoma often present late, even when the disease is biologically aggressive.  
Traditional staging misses these early, costly cases.

---

## Our Evidence Base

From 5,187 patient records across multi-institutional U.S. cohorts, our research shows:
- Menopause acts as a biological switch in sarcoma — changing tumor subtype, mutation load, and treatment eligibility.
- 65.6% of extremity sarcomas in post-menopausal women are diagnosed late-stage.
- Significant rise in genomic instability (FGA) post-menopause.
- 72% of leiomyosarcoma cases occur post-menopause.
- High TMB and low tumor purity are strongly linked to aggressive progression.

## How the Pilot Works

Day 1 – Email deidentified case data (age, sex, diagnosis, basic labs, optional tumor features)  
Day 3 – Receive your MenoSarc Risk Report: risk score, key findings, clinical recommendations  

48-hour turnaround for all cases.

## Payer Workflow & Patient Journey Stage

Trigger Point:  
A claims analyst or case manager flags a suspected or confirmed sarcoma case in a post-menopausal woman.  
This typically happens at first diagnostic confirmation (pathology report) or first oncology referral — the earliest point where intervention can still shift stage and cost trajectory.

Action:  
- Extract the already-available clinical and pathology fields from your EHR or claims system (see "Data We Need" below).  
- Send deidentified case data to AnnieGuard via secure email.  
- Receive a MenoSarc Risk Report within 48 hours, including:  
  - Risk stratification  
  - Key biological drivers  
  - Cost-savings projection based on early intervention potential  

Use:  
- Share results with the treating care team  
- Adjust treatment planning to avoid late-stage costs  
- Track ROI over the pilot period to support leadership buy-in
